# Assembly Code Bug: Potential Buffer Overflow

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet.  The code attempts to access memory indirectly, and without proper bounds checking, this can lead to the program crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior.  The solution provided addresses this vulnerability by adding bounds checking before accessing memory.

## Vulnerability
The main vulnerability lies in the lack of bounds checking.  The code assumes that the value in `ecx` is always within the safe bounds of the array pointed to by `ebx`.  If `ecx` is too large, the program will attempt to access memory outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or security exploit.

## Solution
The solution introduces bounds checking. Before accessing memory, the code verifies that `ecx` is within the acceptable range. This prevents out-of-bounds memory access and mitigates the buffer overflow vulnerability.
